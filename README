-- HGlob --

A simple glob matcher written in Haskell as a learning exercise

-- Special Characters --
?          - Matches any single character
*          - Matches the empty string or any finite string
[...]      - Matches a single character that is in the defined Character Class

-- Character Classes --

A character class is defined in square brackets [...]

Inside a character class definition you can place characters that will be 
members of the class. For example: [bar] will match 'b', 'a', or 'r'. You can
negate the character class with a bang (!) like so: [!not] will match any 
character that is not 'n', 'o', or 't'.

-- Examples --

"foo" `matchesPattern` "foo"
=> True

"foo" `matchesPattern` "fo?"
=> True

"bar" `matchesPattern` "[!f]ar"
=> True

"baz" `matchesPattern` "ba*"
=> True

"baz" `matchesPattern` "*[az][!z]"
=> False
